'evaluate_full_performance...' compares the QUBO method versus some other denoising methods on binary 
images. 
The 'compare_different_sigma_rho_choices_mnist12.py' python file compares the QUBO method against itself with 
different choices of rho, via different choices of sigma to calculate rho. 
The following choices of sigma (relative to the true sigma noise level) are used: 
[1.25*sigma, 1*sigma, 0.75*sigma, 0.5*sigma]. 
The choice of 1*sigma means the we use the true sigma for the denoising. 
This is to test the suggested robustness modification.

It uses the same RBM and produces a similar figure, and also sasves all of the produced data, 
but in the 'data_from_full_eval_mnist12_comparisons' folder within this folder. 
The implementation uses D-wave's SimulatedAnnealing sampler from the neal module, so that this can be 
tested using this heuristic on a conventional computer. To use the QA instead, the functions within 
kergerqubo need only to be modified to use QA in place of the SA.

make_12x12_MNIST makes the 12x12 MNIST images from the original MNIST data (not included here due
to storage capacities, just import it from the website.) It must be run before anything else in this folder, 
since it creates the training and test datasets.
make_mnist_rbm creates trains an rbm to be used for the QUBO and Gibbbs denoising.
